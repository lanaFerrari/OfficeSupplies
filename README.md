# OfficeSupplies

Challenge made for the Nology Course.

## Instructions:
Imagine you’re building a Java application that keeps track of Office Supplies in your workplace 
using Test Driven Development. 

Goals:

1. Office Supply Tracker: The office you currently work at needs to keep track of its 
stationery. They currently have 1000 pens, 200 staplers, 8000 staples, 50 rulers and 300 
A4 Booklets. Build an application that has a stationary interface containing methods for 
adding and removing the items of stationary. Then build classes that implement these 
methods. 

2. TDD: The point in this challenge is to write tests using JUnit. Before you write a line of 
code write tests that will establish whether you have met the below criteria.

Make the following additions to your project: 
Each point should have a corresponding test which utilize the methods created above! 

• If I remove 258 pens, how many do I have left? 
• The office currently has 250 members of staff, each member of staff is to be issued with 
10 pens. How many more pens does the company need to acquire?  
• If each stapler is supplied with 92 staples, will the company run out of staples or 
staplers first? 
• Staff have misplaced 63 rulers, how many new rulers must be ordered in order for the 
company to have 300.  
• Each new member of staff is given 5 pens, 1 stapler, 100 staples, 3 rules and 4 A4 
booklets upon joining the company. How many members of staff could be hired based 
on the current stock?
